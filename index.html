                        <p> Historically, the more specialized crafts with high value products tended to concentrate in
                            urban centers and formed guilds. The skill required by their professions and the need to be
                            permanently involved in the exchange of goods often demanded a generally higher level of
                            education, and craftsmen were usually in a more privileged position than the peasantry in
                            societal hierarchy. The households of craftsmen were not as self-sufficient as those of
                            people
                            engaged in agricultural work and therefore had to rely on the exchange of goods. Some
                            crafts,
                            especially in areas such as pottery, woodworking, and the various stages of textile
                            production,
                            could be practiced on a part-time basis by those also working in agriculture, and often
                            formed
                            part of village life.</p>

                        <p>Handicraft is the "traditional" main sector of the crafts, it is a type of work where useful
                            and
                            decorative devices are made completely by hand or by using only simple tools. Usually the
                            term
                            is applied to traditional means of making goods. The individual artisanship of the items is
                            a
                            paramount criterion, such items often have cultural and/or religious significance. Items
                            made by
                            mass production or machines are not handicraft goods. Handicraft goods are made with craft
                            production processes.The beginning of crafts in areas like the Ottoman Empire involved the
                            governing bodies requiring members of the city who were skilled at creating goods to open
                            shops
                            in the center of town.</p>
